DATA COLLECTION NOTICE

Autodesk respects your privacy.  For details, please see our Privacy Statement located at www.autodesk.com/privacy and specific Privacy Notices and Data Collection Notices in our applications.

In order to support ongoing product improvement efforts, Autodesk receives aggregated product usage information about this application.  This information consists of: product launch and closure which allows us to calculate length and number of application sessions; application commands and operations used; as well as general device information such as Operating System, Web Browser, and Service Provider.  We use Google Analytics, which collects information and then presents the data to us in aggregated form.  Google Analytics collects the following data: session start/stop time, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), time zone.  Note that Google Analytics will not see Internet Protocol (IP) address through the HTTP request to send information.  For clarity, Autodesk does not receive geo-location data (i.e. GPS coordinates).

If you would like to opt-out so that data is not sent to Google Analytics and then aggregated for Autodesk, follow the instructions below. Note that unchecking this option mid-session will prevent data being sent to Google Analytics as of the next use session.  You may opt-out of all data collection by Google Analytics (including non-Autodesk applications) at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout]
