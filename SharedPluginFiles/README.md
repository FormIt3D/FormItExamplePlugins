# SharedPluginFiles
These files are **deprecated**, use the same files now located in their own repo: [SharedPluginUtilities](https://github.com/FormIt3D/SharedPluginUtilities)

The link would change from (FormItInterface.js example)
https://formit3d.github.io/FormItExamplePlugins/SharedPluginFiles/FormItInterface.js
to
https://formit3d.github.io/SharedPluginUtilities/FormItInterface.js


These files will remain to keep old plugins operating.
